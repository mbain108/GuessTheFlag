# GuessTheFlag
Hacking with Swift (Paul Hudson)

In this project I produced a game that shows some random flags to users and asks them to choose which one belongs to a 
particular country.

I revisited:
~ Interface Builder
~ Auto Layout
~ outlets and other things

Some of the things covered:
~ @2x and @3x images
~ asset catalogs
~ integers
~ doubles
~ floats
~ operators (+= and -=)
~ UIButton
~ enums
~ CALayer
~ UIColor
~ random numbers
~ actions
~ string interpolation
~ UIAlertController
~ and more
